## Project Status

This project is unfinished and was primarily a learning experience. My goal was to explore web development concepts and apply them in a real-world scenario. Since this was my first major web project, the separation between the backend and frontend may not be ideal from a developer's perspective.

Despite its imperfections, this project remains one of the most valuable learning experiences I've had. It has helped me gain a deeper understanding of web development, and Iâ€™ve learned a lot throughout the process.

## FAQ

#### What value should I assign to the "EMAIL" environment variable?

It is your foundation, company, or personal email address that you will use to send email verification codes and password reset links to your users.


#### What value should I assing to the 'EMAIL_PASSWORD' environment variable?

If the email account you plan to use does not have 2-step verification, you should use the email password directly.

If the email account has 2-step verification enabled, you will need to generate an app-specific password:

  - Go to **Manage your Google Account.**
  - Navigate **to Security and then App passwords.**
  - Select **Create an app password.**
  - Follow the prompts to **generate a new app password.**
  - Add the generated app password to your **.env** file.
